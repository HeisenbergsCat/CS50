1.  stdint.h is a header file that contais typedefs for exact width intefer types and macros that define types limits
2.  having specific variable sizes is predictable and helps when dealing with porting code to may different platforms.
3.  BYTE: 1, DWORD: 4, LONG: 4, WORD: 2
4.  0x424D, 0x46000000 - bitmap size depend
5.  bfSize - stores the file size (padding and pixels), bfSize - stores the file size (padding, pixels and headers)
6.  When biHeight <0 - top to bottom pixel order
7.  BiBitCount
8.  The file may not exist, user could type wrong name
9.  Because we need it only for redering one block of fixed size data (headers)
10. 3
11. Changes the location of the file pointer
12. It tells fseek to offset the pointer from current location
