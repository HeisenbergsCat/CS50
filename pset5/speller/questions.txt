0.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a word describing a lung desease caudsed by inhaling too much ash. 
    It's the longest word introduced in English Oxford Dictionary. The word is artificial, invented by the president of National
    Puzzlers' League
1.  getrusage returns resource usage measures for given process (SELF, CHILDREN, THERAD)
2.  16
3.  Maybe to avoid loading structs to memory which could alterate calculations.
4.  The main's for loop loads one character to a variable and checks it with a series of conditionals:
    First it'll check if the character is a letter or apostrophy, if it is it'll add it to the WORD and increment index.
    Within the first cinditional is another to check if the sequence of characters already added has a lenght of the longest possible word
    in a dictionary. If it doesn't it discards the invaild part of the word and resets the index counter.
    Next conditional checks if the character is a number. If it is, it discards the word nd resets the index counter.
    
    If a character is not a letter (or apostrophy), not a number and not EOF it means it must be the end of a current word.
    In this case we add a '\0' character to terminate a sequence, increment the word counter and proceed to spellcheck.
5.  I think the main problem could be with all special characters, like :, (, ), etc. fscanf would read them as %s and append to the checked word.
6.  I presume it's for safety reasons, const wont allow the space in memory for variable to be overwritten by enything else.
